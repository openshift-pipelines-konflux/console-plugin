        Background:
            # To run the tests, Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines operator subscription to be updated to refer to main branch of console plugin until this feature is released in operator.
            # To change the subscription to main, follow the below steps
            # Go to Installed operators and select Red Hat OpenShift Pipelines operator
            # Click on Edit subscription in Actions dropdown

            # config:
            #    env:

            #         value: 'ghcr.io/openshift-pipelines/console-plugin:main'
